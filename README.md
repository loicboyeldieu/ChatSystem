# ChatSystem
Distributed (P2P) Chat System in JAVA

We have created a distributed (p2p) chat system. With our system, users are able to communicate by sending or receiving messages using interconnected devices. First of all, every user need to choose an username to connect. Then, once connected, the user has access to the list of users already connected to the system. The local user can select someone in the list to talk with. Our system also enables users to send files. When a user receive a message, he is informed about it by a notification. He has to inform the sender if he has read the message or not. Finally the local user can disconnect and all the users still connected are informed.
